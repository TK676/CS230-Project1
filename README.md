# CS230-Project1
This project was completed for my CS230 (Fundamentals of Computing) class. I was tasked with creating a Python script that would be able to calculate the circumference or area of a circle based on a number that comes from an input by the user.

The user is first prompted by a choice to enter 1, 2, or 0 into the console. The user enters 1 to calculate circumference, 2 to calculate area, and 0 to exit the program. Once they pick which one they would like and enter the respective number, they are then prompted to enter the radius. The program then calculates either the circumference or area and then prints it to the user and then asks them if they would like to choose another calculation or if they would like to exit.
